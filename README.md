# Immortals Standard SSL Robot - Mechanics
Immortals 3D-printed robot mechanical parts for the SSL standard robot

# About this repository
This repository will hold all the information about the Mechanics of the Immortals standard robot. As we would like to demonstrate this new method of mechanical designing in the Small Size League, it's in our mission to release all the original design files to you to be able to learn, reuse and improve. Open Source not only means code, it also concerns hardware.

Weâ€™ve managed to design and manufacture the Immortals standard robot thanks to our previous experience in the 3D printing industry, our engineering background in the small size league and a narrow collaboration with other teams. Our goal is to submit a new standard small size robot which gives the ability to teams to design a robot with various customizations, low-cost of manufacturing and easier to modify.
